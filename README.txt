figure_example.R
This file contains code necessary to replicate the results presented in the paper. Please ensure you run the files sphere_function.R and torus_function.R, which define the necessary sizer functions, before executing this code.

sphere_code.R
draw a SiZer map if spherical data is inputted. Before run this file, make sure to run all of sphere_function.R.

sphere_function.R
contains functions for performing SiZer inference on spherical data, along with auxiliary functions. After run the code in this file, visualization can be performed using sphere_code.R.

torus_code.R
draw a SiZer map if toroidal data is inputted. Before run this file, make sure to run all of torus_function.R.

torus_function.R
contains functions for performing SiZer inference on toroidal data, along with auxiliary functions. After run the code in this file, visualization can be performed using torus_code.R.
